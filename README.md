# Connect4AI
Connect4AI implemented using a minimax Algorithm. 
Created an AI to play the game of Connect 4 using Java in VSCode. Implemented a MiniMax and Alphaâ€“beta pruning algorithm. The program reads a given state of the game, represented as a 2 dimensional array, and gives it a numerical score based on how it evaluates the position. It then makes a recursive search through all the possible moves and evaluates each position that may be reached until a specified depth; then chooses the best move. 
You can interactively play the game versing the AI, another player, or ven pitting 2 AI aginst each other!
